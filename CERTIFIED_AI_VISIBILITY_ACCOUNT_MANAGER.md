## Introduction

The **Certified AI Visibility Account Manager** represents the professional mid-tier certification within the AI Visibility Architecture framework. This credential validates **analytical competence** across the five AI Comprehension stages (Stages 1–5) of the AI Visibility Lifecycle through demonstrated interpretation capability and reporting proficiency.

Unlike course completion certificates that validate learning, **professional certification validates competence** — the ability to interpret AI visibility reports, diagnose comprehension-layer constraints, and communicate findings to inform client decisions.

This certification represents the **analytical and reporting tier** of the discipline: professionals responsible for interpreting visibility data and translating it into actionable insight.

- Proven interpretation capability across visibility reporting systems
- Demonstrated ability to diagnose comprehension-layer constraints
- Evidence-based recommendations within defined scope

## Account Manager Role Scope

The Account Manager role is focused on **interpretation, diagnosis, and communication** across the AI Comprehension stages.

Certified Account Managers are responsible for:

- Interpreting AI Visibility Index reports
- Diagnosing constraints within Stages 1–5
- Communicating findings to clients and stakeholders
- Providing evidence-based recommendations within scope

Account Managers work at the **reporting and interpretation layer**, not the architecture level. System design and structural resolution are handled by Architects.

It distinguishes professionals who:

- Interpret visibility data accurately and professionally
- Diagnose constraints within their certified scope
- Communicate findings clearly to inform client decisions

This credential is awarded only through **demonstrated interpretation capability**, not attendance or coursework alone.

**Pathway to Architect**

## Access and Scope Notice

**Detailed methodologies for AI visibility measurement, architectural frameworks, and diagnostic practices are maintained separately. This paper describes the structural gap — not the operational response.**

Role definitions establish scope and responsibility at the time of publication. Certification standards, enforcement mechanisms, and governance requirements evolve as the AI visibility discipline matures.

Public documentation describes what is happening, not how to address it.
