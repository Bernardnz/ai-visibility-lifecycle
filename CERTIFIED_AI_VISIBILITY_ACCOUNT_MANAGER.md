From The 11-Stage AI Visibility Lifecycle (v0.7)

## Introduction

The **Certified AI Visibility Account Manager** represents the professional certification within the AI Visibility Architecture framework. This credential validates the ability to manage AI-assisted report production across all 11 stages of the AI Visibility Lifecycle, critically review AI-generated output, apply professional judgment, and deliver actionable client reporting.

Unlike course completion certificates that validate learning, **professional certification validates competence** — the demonstrated ability to manage the reporting process end-to-end, ensure governance compliance, and add the human judgment layer that turns evidence into client action.

## The Role

The AI Visibility Account Manager manages the complete AIVA reporting process for a client. The role sits at the centre of the operational chain: AI produces the reports, the Account Manager reviews and adds professional judgment, the client receives and acts.

**What the Account Manager does:**

- Manages AI to produce governance-compliant visibility reports from raw evidence
- Reviews all AI-generated output for governance compliance, factual accuracy, and language standards
- Writes the professional analysis and recommendations — strategic assessment, risk assessment, and next period focus grounded in evidence and client-specific context
- Delivers to the client — presents findings, manages expectations, answers questions, and agrees on next steps

The Account Manager is the quality controller, the professional voice, and the client relationship.

## What Certification Validates

The Certified AI Visibility Account Manager credential validates demonstrated competence across six domains:

- **AI Management** — Ability to direct AI to produce governance-compliant reports across all 11 lifecycle stages
- **Report Review** — Ability to critically review AI output and identify governance violations, unsupported claims, and factual errors
- **Lifecycle Knowledge** — Understanding of all 11 stages, how they relate, and how to interpret stage status for a client
- **Governance Mastery** — Thorough understanding of the core governance rules, language standards, and evidence admissibility
- **Professional Judgment** — Ability to write evidence-based recommendations, manage expectations, and provide client-specific strategic assessment
- **Client Delivery** — Ability to present findings, explain limitations honestly, answer questions, and maintain client confidence without overpromising

This credential does **not** certify architectural capability. It certifies the ability to manage the reporting process, review AI output, and deliver professional client reporting.

## Professional Distinction

The Certified AI Visibility Account Manager credential distinguishes professionals who can manage AI to produce governance-compliant visibility reports, review output critically, interpret status across all 11 lifecycle stages, and deliver actionable intelligence to clients.

This credential is awarded only through **demonstrated competence**, not attendance or coursework alone.

### Pathway to Architect

The Account Manager certification provides a foundation for advancement to **Certified AI Visibility Architect** for those seeking to work at the architectural and infrastructure level of the discipline.

## ACCESS AND SCOPE NOTICE

Detailed methodologies for AI visibility measurement, architectural frameworks, and diagnostic practices are maintained separately. Certification standards and governance requirements evolve as the AI visibility discipline matures.

Public documentation describes what is happening, not how to address it.
