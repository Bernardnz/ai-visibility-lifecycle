## Introduction

The A-to-Z AI-Ready Website Building Workshop is an optional capstone module designed for practitioners who have completed all 11 Stage Modules of the AI Visibility Architecture training program.

Unlike stage-by-stage learning which teaches each dimension independently, this workshop integrates all 11 stages into a single comprehensive website build — demonstrating how the complete AI Visibility Lifecycle operates in production.

---

## Prerequisites

Completion of all 11 Stage Modules is required before enrollment.

---

## Certification

Upon successful completion, students receive:

- A-to-Z Implementation Workshop Certificate
- Complete portfolio project demonstrating holistic mastery
- Production-ready AI Visibility Architecture

---

## Access and Scope Notice

**Detailed methodologies for AI visibility measurement, architectural frameworks, and diagnostic practices are maintained separately. This paper describes the structural gap — not the operational response.**

Public documentation describes what is happening, not how to address it.
