# AI Visibility Lifecycle (v0.7)

The 11-Stage AI Visibility Lifecycle is a stage-based observational framework describing how digital content achieves visibility within AI discovery, comprehension, trust, and human exposure systems.

## Overview

The framework identifies three distinct phases through which domains progress from initial AI crawling to sustainable human-facing visibility:

**Phase 1: AI Comprehension (Stages 1–5)**
AI systems discover, interpret, classify, harmonize, and validate the domain's knowledge structure against global sources.

**Phase 2: Trust Establishment (Stages 6–8)**
AI systems build longitudinal trust, formally accept the domain as reliable, and determine competitive readiness for human surfacing.

**Phase 3: Human Visibility (Stages 9–11)**
AI systems cautiously test the domain with real users, establish baseline ranking, and scale visibility based on sustained positive performance.
